In deloitte internship I have competed a task-
Using a data unification algorithm, the tech team at our client, Daikibo, has converted all telemetry data collected from its 4 factories:
Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)
The reason the client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:
In which location did machines break the most?
What are the machines that broke most often in that location?
Here I Create a Dashboard with sheets and set the chart to be used as a filter (selecting a factory in the first chart shows only the down time of the machines in this factory in the second chart).
These are the screenshots of dashboard and uploaded it as a submission for this task.
